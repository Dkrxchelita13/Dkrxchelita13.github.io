The accelerated advancement of technology has driven the creation of more effective and secure communication networks, where connected devices play a crucial role. This project, entitled “Configuration of a Switched Network with IoT Devices and Services”, focuses on developing a network that not only complies with these standards, but also integrates Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
The context of this study responds to the growing need for robust connectivity solutions in both local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) environments. The interconnection between servers and end devices is essential to ensure efficient communication, which in turn enhances the operability of applications and services in business and home environments.
The main objectives of this project are: to configure a switched network that ensures efficient and secure communication, using a Linux server to implement various services, as well as the correct interconnection of intermediate and end devices. This configuration seeks to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses current connectivity demands.
The document is structured in several sections. It will start with a review of relevant theoretical concepts on switched networks and IdC. Then, the design of the proposed network will be presented, followed by a detailed explanation of the technical configuration and implementation of services on the Linux server.
